tinyramfs - configuration file
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
A tinyramfs configuration file is written in POSIX sh.\& Configuration is done
via variable asignment (eg.\& \fBoption=value\fR).\& Special characters and whitespace
must be quoted or escaped, more info: \fBsh\fR(1).\& By default tinyramfs looks to
\fB/etc/tinyramfs/config\fR for a configuration file.\&
.P
.SH OPTIONS
.P
Option marked with \fB(bool)\fR can hold a value of true or false.\& False if the

.P
Options which expect a device as a value can also refer to the device via
